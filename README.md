This repository contains two sql files and 1 execution report.
Two databases were created to solve the challenges as stated below:
1. Hope Hospital database
This file was used to develop a 3NF relational database for Hope hospital. The database is for the storing of information on the patients, doctors, medical records (diagnosis, medicines, medicine prescribed date, allergies), appointments, and departments. The hospital requested for a system that has the following functionalities:
●	Patient registration
●	Appointment booking/cancellation
●	Review/feedback system for completed appointments
●	Retain inactive patient’s data
Microsoft SQL Server and SSMS were used to implement T-SQL statements and associated database objects in the development of the database.
2. FoodserviceDB database
As a database consultant, I was consulted to develop a database for a food service company. The purpose of the database was to store, retrieve and analyze data on the restaurants, the types of cuisines offered, the consumers and their ratings of the different restaurants. The task is to analyze the data and provide valuable insights to the stakeholders and promote informed business decisions. Four csv (restaurants.csv, ratings.csv, consumers.csv, restaurant_cuisines.csv) were provided by the client. My plan to tackle the task involved understanding the provided data, finding the relationships between the datasets, designing the database and objects, and executing queries for analysis.
Microsoft SQL Server and SSMS were used to implement T-SQL statements and create database objects for the database.
